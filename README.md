# Hi there, Welcome! 👋


I'm Dave, a frontend developer located in Nigeria. Since February 2022, I have been working in the tech industry dedicated to learning and creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites and web apps.

My goal as a frontend developer is to create interfaces that provide an exceptional user experience. I strive to ensure that every design decision I make is based on creating an interface that is easy to use and enhances the overall user experience.

If you are looking for a skilled and experienced frontend developer to create a web application or a website that is both visually appealing and user-friendly, then don't hesitate to contact me. I am always eager to collaborate with others and to take on new challenges in the tech industry.
